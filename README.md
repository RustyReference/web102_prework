## Notes
### Challenges
- Since I was more accustomed to using TypeScript, adjusting to the dynamic typing of JavaScript was slightly challenging. I found that more knowledge of the behavior of certain types came not from documentation of their type, but from their actual behavior as observed in console logs, test functions, etc. 
- I found that I had to look up functions in JavaScript often, which rung a bell that my JavaScript skills could use some work.
